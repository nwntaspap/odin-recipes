        A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk,
        but it's the best I've ever made!
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients-list">
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <li>
          Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large
          bowl. Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a
          separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to
          cook.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <li>
          Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You
          can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles,
          it's ready.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <li>
          Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork
          to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little
          lumpy which is what you want.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <li>
          Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately
          1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1
          to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other
          side. Repeat with remaining batter.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
